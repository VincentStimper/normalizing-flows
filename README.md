`normflows` is a PyTorch implementation of discrete normalizing flows. Many popular flow architectures are implemented,
see the [list below](#implemented-flows). The package can be easily [installed via pip](#installation).
The basic usage is described [here](#usage), and a [full documentation](https://vincentstimper.github.io/normalizing-flows/) 
is available as well. A more detailed description of this package is given in our
[accompanying paper](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.05361).

Several sample use cases are provided in the 
[`examples` folder](https://github.com/VincentStimper/normalizing-flows/blob/master/examples), 
including [Glow](https://github.com/VincentStimper/normalizing-flows/blob/master/examples/glow.ipynb),
a [VAE](https://github.com/VincentStimper/normalizing-flows/blob/master/examples/vae.py), and
a [Residual Flow](https://github.com/VincentStimper/normalizing-flows/blob/master/examples/residual.ipynb).
Moreover, two simple applications are highlighed in the [examples section](#examples). You can run them 
yourself in Google Colab using the links below to get a feeling for `normflows`.

## Installation

The latest version of the package can be installed via pip

```
pip install normflows
```

At least Python 3.7 is required. If you want to use a GPU, make sure that
PyTorch is set up correctly by following the instructions at the
[PyTorch website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).

To run the example notebooks clone the repository first

```
git clone https://github.com/VincentStimper/normalizing-flows.git
```

and then install the dependencies.

```
pip install -r requirements_examples.txt
```

## Usage

A normalizing flow consists of a base distribution, defined in 
[`nf.distributions.base`](https://github.com/VincentStimper/normalizing-flows/blob/master/normflows/distributions/base.py),
and a list of flows, given in
[`nf.flows`](https://github.com/VincentStimper/normalizing-flows/blob/master/normflows/flows).
Let's assume our target is a 2D distribution. We pick a diagonal Gaussian
base distribution, which is the most popular choice. Our flow shall be a
[Real NVP model](https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkpbnH9lx) and, therefore, we need
to define a neural network for computing the parameters of the affine coupling
map. One dimension is used to compute the scale and shift parameter for the
other dimension. After each coupling layer we swap their roles.

```python
import normflows as nf

# Define 2D Gaussian base distribution
base = nf.distributions.base.DiagGaussian(2)

# Define list of flows
num_layers = 32
flows = []
for i in range(num_layers):
    # Neural network with two hidden layers having 64 units each
    # Last layer is initialized by zeros making training more stable
    param_map = nf.nets.MLP([1, 64, 64, 2], init_zeros=True)
    # Add flow layer
    flows.append(nf.flows.AffineCouplingBlock(param_map))
    # Swap dimensions
    flows.append(nf.flows.Permute(2, mode='swap'))
```

Once they are set up, we can define a
[`nf.NormalizingFlow`](https://github.com/VincentStimper/normalizing-flows/blob/master/normflows/core.py#L9)
model. If the target density is available, it can be added to the model
to be used during training. Sample target distributions are given in
[`nf.distributions.target`](https://github.com/VincentStimper/normalizing-flows/blob/master/normflows/distributions/target.py).

```python
# If the target density is not given
model = nf.NormalizingFlow(base, flows)

# If the target density is given
target = nf.distributions.target.TwoMoons()
model = nf.NormalizingFlow(base, flows, target)
```

The loss can be computed with the methods of the model and minimized.

```python
# When doing maximum likelihood learning, i.e. minimizing the forward KLD
# with no target distribution given
loss = model.forward_kld(x)

# When minimizing the reverse KLD based on the given target distribution
loss = model.reverse_kld(num_samples=512)

# Optimization as usual
loss.backward()
optimizer.step()
```

## Examples

We provide several illustrative examples of how to use the package in the
[`examples`](https://github.com/VincentStimper/normalizing-flows/blob/master/examples)
directory. Among them are implementations of 
[Glow](https://github.com/VincentStimper/normalizing-flows/blob/master/examples/glow.ipynb),
a [VAE](https://github.com/VincentStimper/normalizing-flows/blob/master/examples/vae.py), and
a [Residual Flow](https://github.com/VincentStimper/normalizing-flows/blob/master/examples/residual.ipynb). 
More advanced experiments can be done with the scripts listed in the
[repository about resampled base distributions](https://github.com/VincentStimper/resampled-base-flows),
see its [`experiments`](https://github.com/VincentStimper/resampled-base-flows/tree/master/experiments)
folder.

Below, we consider two simple 2D examples.

### Real NVP applied to a 2D bimodal target distribution

<a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/VincentStimper/normalizing-flows/blob/master/examples/real_nvp_colab.ipynb" target="_parent"><img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"/></a>

In [this notebook](https://github.com/VincentStimper/normalizing-flows/blob/master/examples/real_nvp_colab.ipynb), 
which can directly be opened in 
[Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/VincentStimper/normalizing-flows/blob/master/examples/real_nvp_colab.ipynb),
we consider a 2D distribution with two half-moon-shaped modes as a target. We approximate it with a Real NVP model
and obtain the following results.

![2D target distribution and Real NVP model](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VincentStimper/normalizing-flows/master/figures/real_nvp.png)

Note that there might be a density filament connecting the two modes, which is due to an architectural limitation 
of normalizing flows, especially prominent in Real NVP. You can find out more about it in 
[this paper](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v151/stimper22a).

### Modeling a distribution on a cylinder surface with a neural spline flow

<a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/VincentStimper/normalizing-flows/blob/master/examples/paper_example_nsf_colab.ipynb" target="_parent"><img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"/></a>

In [another example](https://github.com/VincentStimper/normalizing-flows/blob/master/examples/paper_example_nsf_colab.ipynb),
which is available in [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/VincentStimper/normalizing-flows/blob/master/examples/paper_example_nsf_colab.ipynb)
as well, we apply a Neural Spline Flow model to a distribution defined on a cylinder. The resulting density is visualized below.

![Neural Spline Flow applied to target distribution on a cylinder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VincentStimper/normalizing-flows/master/figures/nsf_cylinder_3d.png)

This example is considered in the [paper](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.05361) accompanying this repository.
